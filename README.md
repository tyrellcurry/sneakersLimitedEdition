### What I learned

I built this product page from scratch over a weekend (Dec. 9th - 11th, 2023) to learn and explore the PHP framework Twig.

#### A few awesome things I learned was:

Doing equations with data pulled in using Twig, in this case getting the discounted amount:

```twig
${{ products.shoes.original_price * (products.shoes.discount / 100) }}
```

Rendering data based on conditionals:

```twig
{% if products.shoes.discount is empty %}
//do something
{% else %}
//do something else
{% endif %}
```
Sending data to the Twig components I created:

```twig
{% for productKey, product in products %}
{{ include('Components/product.twig', {'product': product}) }}
{% endfor %}
```
Creating arrays in PHP:

```php
$data = [
    'pageTitle' => 'Sneakers | Limited Edition Sample',
    'products' => [ ... ]
]
```
Loading and passing data into Twig templates:

```php
$template = $twig->load('index.twig');
echo $template->render($data);
```

### Continued development

I would like to explore the Twig framework more in depth, as well as set up a backend to utilize PHP better.
